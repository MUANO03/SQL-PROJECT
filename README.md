# SQL-PROJECT
Customer Insights Project â€“ SQL & Data Analysis

This project focused on identifying top-performing cities based on customer transactions and revenue. I extracted, cleaned, and analyzed large datasets using SQL Server, leveraging advanced techniques such as CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and subqueries to merge and transform data across multiple relational tables.

Through a combination of data validation checks and aggregation logic (SUM(), RANK(), and GROUP BY), I ensured the dataset maintained an accuracy rate above 80%. Once cleaned, I designed ranking metrics to pinpoint cities driving the highest sales and customer engagement.

The findings revealed regional performance trends that guided the marketing team to focus on high-value areas, improving targeted campaign efficiency and budget allocation.

Tools Used: SQL Server | Excel | Data Validation | Query Optimization
Key Impact: Enabled data-driven marketing prioritization through accurate regional insights.
